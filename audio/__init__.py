"""
Audio Processing System for SoundBridge

Provides advanced audio processing capabilities including volume normalization,
real-time effects, multi-stream mixing, and enhanced audio quality management.
Built on the core infrastructure for seamless integration.

Key Components:
- Audio processing pipeline with real-time controls
- Volume normalization and dynamic range management
- Audio effects chain (EQ, crossfading, ducking)
- Multi-stream mixing with priority management
- Performance monitoring and quality adaptation

Architecture:
- Built on core ServiceRegistry, StateManager, EventBus, and ConfigurationManager
- Real-time audio processing with minimal latency
- Per-guild audio configuration and state management
- Integration with Discord.py voice capabilities
- Event-driven audio control and monitoring
